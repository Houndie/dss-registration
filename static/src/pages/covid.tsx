		<h2>Policy</h2>
		<p>This year, Dayton Swing Smackdown has no specific covid policy.  We still strongly encourage attendees to get the most up to date vaccines.  Masks are also optional, but encouraged.</p>
		<p>We also strongly encourage all attendees to take a covid test prior to attending the event. They are inexpensive and quick, and you can easily help prevent others from getting sick.</p>
		<h2>Refunds</h2>
		<p>If requested, we will refund your money fully up to the start of the event, and proportionally throughout the course of the event, if requested, for any reason.  If you are sick, stay home, we will refund you.  If you think you might be exposed, stay home, we will refund you.  If you are getting bad vibes, you may stay home and we will refund you.  Refunds are not conditional on having to provide any explanation. Please don't feel obligated to come just because you paid; we want the event to be as safe as possible.</p>
