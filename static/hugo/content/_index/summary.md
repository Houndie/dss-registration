## We're doing an intermission year!

**Spend some time online with us on February 27!**

Due to the covid-19 pandemic, we obviously don't feel comfortable having an in-person event, but that doesn't mean we can't still have a grand time digitally!  We're putting on a one day event with 3 classes, a discussion talk, a DJ party, and THE BATTLE OF THE SWING CITIES TEAM *VIDEO* COMPETITION!  Mark down your calendars now, you don't want to miss this!

Because of the reduced nature of this event, we're offering the intermission *completely free* so you have no reason not to be there!
