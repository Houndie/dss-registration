## Battle of the Swing Cities VIDEO Team Competition

**Team registration: Free!!!!!**

* Competition winners are provided event passes to Dayton Swing Smackdown 2022
* Teams submit a video of them swing dancing.  This video can be cut and edited as you see fit!
* There must be 6 unique individuals dancing in this video.  Not all individuals have to be in the video ta the same time or in the same shot.
* Routine must be at least 2:30 minutes long.  No set maximum this year!
* While music and choreography should be predominantly “swing”, this event has a history of routines that include non-swing elements. There are no restrictions on the genre of routine songs. Routines should strive for at least 60% swing content in the routine (not a disqualifying offense).
