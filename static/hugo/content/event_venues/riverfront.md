### B&B Riverfront Hall

* Saturday Afternoon Lessons

17R South Main Street  
Miamisburg, OH

Located one block away from the Baum Opera House, it’s the perfect location for our second track of instruction.  Originally a “square dance hall” boasting over 3,000 sq. ft., origninal floating oak dance floor, and can easily accomodate a party of 250 persons with adequate room to “dance the night away”.

Parking is available behind the building.
