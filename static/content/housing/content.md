Dayton Swing Smackdown is pleased to be able to offer registrants a limited amount of housing space with local hosts for no cost.  If local housing is not your style, then we recommend staying at the Hawthorn Suites Hotel, just minutes from downtown Maimisburg, where the Saturday events will take place.

## Local Housing

Locals from the Dayton area are offering a limited amount of housing for attendees.  Housing will be provided to individuals in the order in which they registered.  Just indicate you would like housing on your registration form.  If you absolutely can only afford to attend this event if housing is provided, make sure you register as early as possible!

## Hawthorn Suites Hotel

Due to declining interest, Smackdown no longer operates a set room block for participants.  However, we still encourage participants who are looking for a hotel room to look at the Hawthorn Suites Hotel as an option...it's under ten minutes from the Opera House, and under a minute from Elegance in Dance (our late night and Sunday venue).  See the room options below
